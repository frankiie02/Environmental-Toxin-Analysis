# Environmental-Toxin-Analysis
conduct an exploratory data analysis on EcoGuard's river toxin data using Python


Key Findings:

Significant Differences between Amazon and Nile: Independent t-tests revealed statistically significant differences in toxin levels between the Amazon and Nile river systems. This indicates distinct water quality characteristics and potential variations in pollution sources between these major rivers.

Correlation between pH and Toxin Levels: A moderate correlation was observed between pH levels and the concentrations of toxins like Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, Nitrates, and Phosphates. This suggests that pH plays a role in influencing the presence and levels of these toxins, warranting further investigation into the underlying chemical processes.

Seasonal Variation in Toxin Concentrations: Preliminary analysis using box plots hinted at potential seasonal variations in toxin concentrations. Certain toxins might exhibit higher levels during specific seasons, possibly due to factors like rainfall patterns, temperature changes, or agricultural practices. Further analysis is needed to confirm and understand these seasonal trends.

Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression: Linear regression models were built to predict toxin levels based on pH. The results showed varying degrees of correlation, with some toxins demonstrating strong relationships with pH while others exhibited weaker associations. This highlights the complexity of chemical interactions within river systems and the need for considering multiple factors in predictive models.

Identification of Top Polluted River Systems: The analysis identified the top 5 most polluted river systems based on average toxin levels, facilitating targeted monitoring and intervention efforts. Trends in toxin levels over time for these critical rivers were visualized to track changes and assess the effectiveness of pollution control measures.
